          <p>One of the most peculiar thing i have seen in my short yet 
            interesting UX journey so far is that we often get overwhelmed
            by the Design trends and end up creating something that is far
            away from being practical in terms of development and scaling.
            I have come across many dashboards on behance that have great 
            aesthetics but doesnt even have proper navigation and drill down
            which results in great UI but bad UX.               
          </p>    
  
          <p>One of the standard practices of learning UX is to pick up an
            existing app and try to design better flows and functionalities
            that can solve current problems. This ofcourse will need a lot of 
            user research. Hence picking up a popular app is always helpful.
            A strong user research is the key to a great user experience, as 
            you can build great modern functionalities in your app or website
            but only a great research on user behaviour will tell you which is
            the most relevant one.
